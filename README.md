## Hi I'm Justin.

I'm a data scientist who loves experimentation, data-driven insights, and simplifying the process. I currently work in the biotechnology industry and solve problems related to process and manufacturing. I'm focused on the intersection of healthcare and data science. 

### ðŸ”­ Some projects I've worked on:

- Built a cgm [web tool](https://0198a743-8aac-6e01-b377-b7c90b9f1907.share.connect.posit.cloud) that lets clinicans analyze cgm data via interactive plots and metrics. Also implemented advanced measures of glucose variability to bring out further insights.
- Logged and analyzed data from wearables and symptom logs via Bearable App. Constructed behavioral model using machine learning (regression, tree-based) to predict responses. 
- Developed a [web app](https://flavorspace-nkugmzxwvtc7fffhsyd5tj.streamlit.app/) that uses NLP and machine learning to make recipe recommendations based off of nutrition and flavors.

### ðŸŒ± I believe continuous education is essential. Iâ€™m currently learning about:

- Deploying ML pipelines and workflows onto cloud 
- Practical applications of LLM
