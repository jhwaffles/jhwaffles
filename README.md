## Hi I'm Justin

I'm a data scientist who loves experimentation and simplifying the process. I currently work in the biotechnology industry and solve problems related to process and manufacturing. I'm focused on the intersection of healthcare and data science. [test](https://flavorspace-r842sv8gcz7vnx9ps6pwts.streamlit.app/)
