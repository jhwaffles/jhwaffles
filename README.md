## Hi I'm Justin.

I'm a data scientist who loves experimentation, data-driven insights, and simplifying the process. I currently work in the biotechnology industry and solve problems related to process and manufacturing. I'm focused on the intersection of healthcare and data science. 

### 🔭 What I’m currently working on:

- Building [web tools](https://connect.posit.cloud/jhwaffles/content/0198a743-8aac-6e01-b377-b7c90b9f1907) to log and analyze data from wearables and symptom logs (sleep, cgm, diet, symptoms)
- Developing a [web app](https://flavorspace-nkugmzxwvtc7fffhsyd5tj.streamlit.app/) that uses NLP and machine learning to make recipe recommendations based off of nutrition and flavors.

### 🌱 I believe continuous education is essential. I’m currently learning about:

- Deploying ML pipelines and workflows onto cloud 
- Practical applications of LLM

### ⚡ Fun facts:

- In my off time I enjoy climbing at my local gym, batch-cooking nutritious food, and reading.
