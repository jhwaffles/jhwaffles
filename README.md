## Hi I'm Justin

I'm a data scientist who loves experimentation and simplifying the process. I currently work in the biotechnology industry and solve problems related to process and manufacturing. I'm focused on the intersection of healthcare and data science. 

### ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Developing a [web app](https://flavorspace-nkugmzxwvtc7fffhsyd5tj.streamlit.app/) that uses NLP and machine learning to make recipe recommendations based off of nutrition and flavors. 
- Building tools to log and analyze personal data (recipes, health data, etc)

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

I believe continuous education is essential. Here are a few technologies and concepts I'm currently learning about:

- Evaluating Streamlit and Shiny as a way to rapidly protoype and share analysis using Python.
- Practical applications of LLM.
